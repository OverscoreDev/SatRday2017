# SatRday2017 (Devops and Shiny)
This is a Repository of all the Resources from my talk (Marko Jakovljevic) at the Cape Town SatrDay Conference

> Get started with downloading the [Slide Deck here](https://view.attach.io/BJlisRYYg)  - This is what you can use to follow with the documents

*******

**Assumptions**

This document assumes that you are familiar with SSH, SSH Keys, Linux Command line and that you have an Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) Server running somewhere. 

This document also assumes that you know how to use R and Shiny Server. If you need some instructions on this here are some good articles. 

**General Resources**

[Docker Installation Pages](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

[Docker Run Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

[Docker Compose Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

[Shiny Server Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/)

**TODO**

- Add SSL Encryption into the Docker-compose stack for Auth0 + Shiny + Nginx (Letsencrypt)
- Nginx Optimizations


## PART A - Docker

### Docker installation

But first, let's update the package database:

`sudo apt-get update`
Now let's install Docker. Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:

Make sure all system packages are up to date, add the Keyserver repo and update and install docker-engine

```
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D

sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main'

sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
```
Ensure to add the relevant users to the Docker group 

`sudo adduser USER docker` and for current user `sudo adduser $USER docker`

### Docker Quick Reference

Here are some commands you can use to get started with exploring Docker. 

1. `docker search` will help you find what you are looking for in terms of images that are currently open repositories on the Docker hub

2. `docker pull owner/image:tag` 

3. So let's start by searching for Docker ubuntu `docker search ubuntu` and pull the image `docker pull ubuntu:16.04`

4. To run the docker image run `docker -it ubuntu:16.04 bash` which means you are getting an interactive shell psuedo tty attached to STDIN/ERR/OUT

5. To detach from a container without stopping it you can press `Ctrl+P and Ctrl+Q` successively or `exit`

6. List all containers - `docker ps -a` / List all images `docker images`

7. Starting and stopping containers:
`docker start <containerid>` and `docker stop <containerid>`

8. Remove all containers and stop them at the same time
`docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)`

**Private Image repositories** 
You can setup your own private emails with `quay.io` or `cloud.docker.com` among many others. 

`docker login quay.io` or `docker login` to login to the Docker Cloud Repository

### Pulling the Docker Shiny Container

Let's go ahead an pull the Shiny image created by `rocker` by running `docker pull rocker/shiny` - this will pull the latest tag of the Rocker/shiny container

This image is built from the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rocker-org/shiny/blob/master/Dockerfile) and the Entrypoint command which is [shiny-server.sh](https://github.com/rocker-org/shiny/blob/master/shiny-server.sh)

To run this container on your host you can now run
`docker run -d -p 3838:3838 rocker/shiny` This command exposes the HOST:CONTAINER ports 3838:3838 respectively and runs the shiny image in the background. 

You can now access the container by going to a browser and typing in `http://IPADDRESSOFHOST:3838`
You should see "Welcome to Shiny Server"

#### Shiny Apps
In order to 'mirror' your shiny apps from your host to the container you could also run:

`docker run -d -v /path/to/your/shinyapps/:/srv/shiny-server -p 3838:3838 rocker/shiny`

#### Building our own custom shiny container

Let's start by taking hte Dockerfile and shiny-server.sh from the Repository above. I've created a copy of them in 
[/shiny/Dockerfile](shiny/Dockerfile) and [/shiny/shiny-server.sh](/shiny/shiny-server.sh)

comes from r-base:latest which is also $VERSION locked

Let's use the Dockerfile from Rocker to generate our own Shiny Server with our own packages we require.
From the Dockerfile:

```
RUN wget --no-verbose https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-shiny-server-os-build/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/VERSION -O "version.txt" && \
    VERSION=$(cat version.txt)  && \
    wget --no-verbose "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-shiny-server-os-build/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/shiny-server-$VERSION-amd64.deb" -O ss-latest.deb && \
    gdebi -n ss-latest.deb && \
    rm -f version.txt ss-latest.deb && \
    R -e "install.packages(c('shiny', 'rmarkdown'), repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')" && \
    cp -R /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/shiny/examples/* /srv/shiny-server/

```
We can now add `RUN R -e "install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'dplyr'))"` to the Dockerfile 

**Building the image**
Now we can build our image by `cd` to the directory that contains the Dockerfile and shiny-server.sh and running
`docker build -t yourimage -f Dockerfile .`

You now have your own custom Shiny image. To push this to a repo (after logging in) you can run `docker push yourimage`

Now we can run it `docker run -d -p 3838:3838 -v /home/chiron/shinyapps/:/srv/shiny-server yourimage`

OK what have we done: We have built our own shiny server that resides in the cloud
We bring this down to any computer anywhere and work on it. Share whatever local folder contains the apps

#### Get a custom Nginx running

The nginx image we are using is from [Github Nginx](https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/blob/7b33a90d7441909664a920b0687db8d984ac314b/mainline/jessie/Dockerfile)

I've created a copy of this Dockerfile in [/nginx-shiny/web](/nginx-shiny/web/Dockerfile)
The changes to this file include:

```
RUN rm -v /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Copy a configuration file from the current directory
ADD nginx.conf /etc/nginx/

COPY .htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd
```
What this means is that we are removing the nginx.conf that comes with the default install and adding our own nginx.conf which contains the PROXY_PASS (Reverse Proxy) + Basic Authentication which is adding basic authentication off the .htpasswd file

From the [nginx.conf](/nginx-shiny/nginx.conf)

```
worker_processes 1;

events { worker_connections 1024; }

http {

    sendfile on;

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
          proxy_pass http://shiny:3838/;
          proxy_redirect http://shiny:3838/ $scheme://$host/;
          auth_basic "Username and Password are required";
          auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        }
      }
}

```
The important part is near the bottom. Take a look at the last location / block. This block tells Nginx to handle all requests. Inside this block you will find two directives: proxy_pass and proxy_redirect. These directives tell Nginx to proxy requests to the host passed as parameter to them. This is were you should edit the configuration file to point it to your shiny-auth0 authentication server, which we will setup later on in this guide.

##### Adding HTACCESS Users

On your host `sudo apt-get install apache2-utils`

Make sure you are sitting in the `nginx-shiny` directory. You can now run

`~/nginx-shiny/web$ htpasswd -c .htpasswd your_user_name`

Now build your web image in your /nginx-shiny/web path

`docker build -t webimage -f Dockerfile .`

****

## PART B - Shiny Server Authentication & Orchestration

Let's now use the principles in PART A To set-up a Shiny + Nginx container stack so that we have basic HTTP authentication on the Shiny Container

We can now put this together

**Install Docker-compose**
Make sure that when installing Docker-compose you are not installing the version from the Ubuntu repo but rather from  Docker. Here are the instructions:

1. Run `sudo -i`

2. Grab the binary `curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

3. Apply executable permissions to the binary:
`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

4. Logout and login again 

5. Check your versions

`docker-compose --version` should output docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387
`docker --version` should output Docker version 1.13.1, build 092cba3

(Note at writing 20/02/2017)

### Putting Nginx and Shiny togeter with Docker-compose

Check our the [docker-compose.yml](/nginx-shiny/docker-compose.yml) to see how this works.
Basically we are stacking TWO containers (Shiny from rocker/shiny) and our web container which is **built** from the /web directory. 

From the `~/nginx-shiny` directory you can run `docker-compose up`

You can now access the container by going to a browser and typing in `http://IPADDRESSOFHOST`
You'll need to login with your_user_name as per the Nginx steps above and should see "Welcome to Shiny Server"
scp -r /home/chiron/0-Dev/satrday/nginx chiron@ :/home/

### Shiny with Rstudio using Docker-compose

You can now go `~/shiny-rstudio` and then check out the [docker-compose.yml](/shiny-rstudio/docker-compose.yml)
To run this stack you can access this via:


### Out of the Box Auth0 Implementation (Almost complete)

These instructions are from the following [Auth0 Article](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-authentication-to-shiny-server/) - For now I suggest using this article as I am still putting together the documentation

You can now put the learnings above into a central easy to set-up Shiny Server authentication from Auth0.com
We can start with the nginx.conf that we are going to use instead of the previous nginx.conf

Check it out here:

[nginx.conf](/nginx-shiny-auth0/nginx.conf)

Modified the proxy_pass from localhost:3000 to `shiny:3838` as this is the hostname and port as per the docker-compose stack.

**Step 3: Setting up and Auth0 Account for shiny-auth0**

Since authentication will be handled by Auth0, a free Auth0 account is required to work with shiny-auth0. Don't panic, it's as simple as signing-up and setting a few knobs here and there. Let's take a look.

First, head over to https://auth0.com and signup. Follow the steps to fill in your details. For simple use cases, a free account is more than enough. With a free account you get up to 7000 users. If you need more than that, check our pricing page.

After you have completed the signup process, access the Auth0 Dashboard and create a new client for our shiny-auth0 app. This client will let you setup how your users will log-in through shiny-auth0. You have several options you must consider: will you use a standard username/password database? Or will you allow social logins (through Facebook or Google, for example)? It is up to you to decide what fits best your use case. For simplicity, we will go with a simple social login through Google. We will only allow certain users access to our Shiny Server.

To create a client go to Client on the sidebar and then Create Client on the top right of the screen. Pick a name and then select the type of client. Select Regular Web Applications. Ignore the quickstart that is presented after that and go straight to Settings.

![](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/shiny-server-2/settings.png)

Take note of the `Client ID`, `Domain` and the `Client Secret`.
You will need these later to setup shiny-auth0. Another important setting is the Allowed Callback URLs setting visible below. This is the URL the user will be redirected to after a successful authentication attempt. It is formed by the domain of your public server plus the callback path. For instance: https://shiny.yourhost.com/callback.

#### Notes

- The shiny-auth0-master is a direct download from the [Auth0 Shiny Repo](https://github.com/auth0/shiny-auth0)
- You'll need to follow the article for the time being
- Make sure to install Node.js and NPm in the SHINY Container (Will update the Dockerfile shortly)
